            <h3>UI/UX and Front-End Developer</h3>
            <p>Greetings from Badruddoza Dhrubo from Bangladesh.
                I am studying at Computer Science & Engineering in United International University in Bangladesh. I am
                working to establish my career in information & technology. I have chosen this career as I am good at
                ICT
                and this is the place where I believe that I am the best.
                Freelancing is not only my profession but also is my passion. My main objective is to provide best
                output to
                my client. You can believe me that I will ensure my academic knowledge and practical experience for your
                order with sheer determination and commitment.
                I am much experienced in Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, lightroom, indesign, MS Word and Power Point.
            </p>
